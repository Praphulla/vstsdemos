The main idea of Writage is providing opportunity to write in Markdown to those
who like Microsoft Word. There are lots of Markdown editors such as iA Writer,
Texts, WriteMonkey or Byword and online Markdown writing services, like
StackEdit, Dillinger or Markable for people who like to have minimalistic,
distraction-free interface. And there is nothing for those who prefer to use
rich interface and features of Microsoft Word.

So Writage is designed for everyone who likes to start writing well-structured
documents and don't have time or don't want to drill into details Markdown
syntax or prefer to use Word as a text editor.

Writage enables Microsoft Word to create and edit Markdown files (with .md
.markdown or .text extensions). You could also save your .doc file as Markdown
file.

The following Markdown elements are supported:

-   Headings,

-   Lists (numbered and bulleted),

-   Links,

-   Font styles such as bold, italic,

-   Tables

-   Footnotes
